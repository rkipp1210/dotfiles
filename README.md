# dotfiles

Just a simple place for my dotfiles...nothing too special here.

### Files:
* .aliases -> This file holds all aliases.
* .bash_profile -> set the path and source all these dotfiles.
* .bash_prompt -> colors and stuff.  Stole this guy from https://github.com/gf3/dotfiles
* .bashrc -> where all the magic happens
* .git-completion.bash -> tab completion for git. Great one.
* .helpers -> any helper functions
